# FYproject (Title: Cryptography Teaching Tool)
<p>This is a final year computer sciecne project created by (Andy) Man Tik Yu.</p>

# Description
<p>Cryptography is an exiting subarea in Security that often motivates many students to learn more about Security.</p>
<p>The purpuse of this project is to build a tool that helps students with their understanding of cryptographic /security principles.</p>
<p>The age group here is open: it could be primary school children, secondary school children (who possibly would be interested your tool at an open day), foundation year students, or student studying cyber security. The choice of topics/algorithm and the teaching technique chosen should be adapted to the age chosen.</p>

# The choice of topic
<p>This project is aimed to develop an educational game and targeted to school children in order to teach them topics of cryptography and online security.</p>

# Software tool
