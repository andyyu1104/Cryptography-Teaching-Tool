# FYproject (Title: Cryptography Teaching Tool)
<p>This is a final year computer sciecne project created by (Andy) Man Tik Yu.</p>

# Description
<p>Cryptography is an exiting subarea in Security that often motivates many students to learn more about Security.</p>
<p>The purpuse of this project is to build a tool that helps students with their understanding of cryptographic /security principles.</p>
<p>The age group here is open: it could be primary school children, secondary school children (who possibly would be interested your tool at an open day), foundation year students, or student studying cyber security. The choice of topics/algorithm and the teaching technique chosen should be adapted to the age chosen.</p>

# The choice of topic
<p>This project is aimed to develop an educational game and targeted to school children in order to teach them topics of cryptography and online security with interactive game elements</p>
<p>There will be 5 sections in this game for player:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Password</li>
  <li>Online Attack</li>
  <li>Classic Cipher</li>
  <li>Modern Cipher</li>
  <li>Quiz</li>
</ul>
<p>The Password and Online Attack sections are presented as mini game features. Cipher sections are giving more text details and interactive cipher try-out to understand cipher applications and algorithms.</p>
<p>After finished above sectons, players can test themselve about the knowledge they learnt from the game in Quiz section where can justify and reflect their understanding as well as bring the obtained knowledge out to apply in the real world.</p>

# Software tools
<p>The tools used in this project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>C#</li>
  <li>Unity</li>
</ul>

# Research method
In this project, I have interviewed one secondary school child and one primary school child to conduct the efficiency of eduactional game with their attention and quiz scores within this game.

# Game Details
<p>The game is published on <a href="https://andyyu1104.itch.io/cryptographylearningtool">itch.io</a>.</p>
<p>Platform: Windows</p>
